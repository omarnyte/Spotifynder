Did you know that Spotify categorizes its library of artists with over 900 genres? What is *metropopolis*? What about *escape room*? To Spotify, *wrestling* is also a genre.

Genre Connect integrates Spotify's API to visually depict an artist's
related genres. A user types in (or speaks!) an artist name. The page then renders a chart listing twenty of the the selected artist's related artists. A graph also displays how many times each of those genres appear among those related artists.

## Features
- Voice search (only available on Chrome)
- Dropdown search bar with search suggestions
- Audio previews of related artists
- Interactive bar graph built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.

## Future Features
- A user can provide a saved playlist or their entire library, and the app will provide the user with stats about their genres.
